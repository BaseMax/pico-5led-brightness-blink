# pico-5led-brightness-blink
This project demonstrates how to control a set of 5 LEDs connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico. The LEDs respond to two buttons, with functionality for toggling ON/OFF states, adjusting brightness with a potentiometer, and a special mode when both buttons are pressed simultaneously.
